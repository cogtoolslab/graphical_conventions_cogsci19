### prep_sketches_for_recognition
Note about datasets: 

`recog_id` refers to a unique session type in the recognition experiment, where all the sketches are guaranteed to have been generated by different participants in different repetition cycles

`graphical_conventions_sketches_yoked` : 67 bundles of 40 trials (each bundle corresponding to 1 refgame)

`graphical_conventions_sketches_scrambled40` : 67 bundles of 40 trials (the four trials of each repetition coming from different games)

`graphical_conventions_sketches_scrambled10` : 268 bundles of 10 trials (each trial corresponding to some repetition (8 repeated + 2 control))
