<h2><center>Guess My Sketch!</center>  </h2>

	<p>

	  In this experiment you will play a fun communication game with
	  another player on MTurk! In each round both of you are going to
    be shown a set of objects like this:
</p>
    <p>
      <center><img src="images/6chairs.png" alt="Example objects" style="width:600px;height:100px"></center>
    </p>
<p>
    There are two sets of objects. You can distinguish the sets by the color of
    the border around the objects on each trial: <b style="color: #ce0a04">red</b> or <b style="color: #4286f4">blue</b>. The above is an example of a red set.
    Note that one of the sets might appear more often than the other.
    On each trial, you will see the same set as your partner <b> but the order the objects are in
	  will be different</b>.

</p>

<p>

    One of you will be assigned the <b>Sketcher</b> role and the
    other will be the <b>Viewer</b>. On each round, one of the
    objects is the <b>target</b>, which is outlined in white. Only the
    Sketcher can see which object is the target.

</p>

<p>

    The goal of the Sketcher is to make a sketch of the target so
    that the Viewer can figure out which object the target is, as quickly
    as possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are the Sketcher, please do your best to make a sketch of
    each target from the perspective that is shown in the picture. <b> Please
    do NOT draw text labels, arrows, or any background for the object.</b>

  </p>

      <p> The Viewer can click on an object and confirm their selection
      by clicking the "confirm" button under the objects. The Viewer can only click the "confirm"
      button if a Sketcher has sketched something or has run out of time.
      <b>Once the "confirm" button is clicked, the response is submitted and
      the Viewer cannot change their selection.</b>
      Both players will be given feedback; the Sketcher will see what the Viewer
      clicked (highlighted in black), and the Viewer will see the true target
      (highlighted in green). Then you will both automatically advance to
      the next round of objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    For each correct guess the Viewer makes, both of you will receive
    <b>an accuracy bonus of $0.03</b>. In addition, you will both receive <b>
    a time bonus (up to $0.01) based on how fast the Viewer makes the correct guess</b>.
    In other words, <b> the faster the Viewer can select the correct object,
    the larger the bonus both of you will receive</b>.
</p>
    <p>For example, if the Viewer makes a correct guess after 6 seconds,
    both of you will receive: $0.03 (accuracy bonus) + $0.008 (time bonus) =
    $0.038 (total bonus). If the guess was made at 12 seconds, the time bonus
    will be reduced to $0.006, making the total $0.036. If the guess was made at
    30 seconds or later, there is no time bonus, but you will still receive
    $0.03 (accuracy bonus) if the Viewer makes a correct guess.
    Finally, <b>incorrect guesses do not receive any bonus</b> regardless of their
    accuracy.

  </p>
    <p>
    The bonus meter above the sketchpad displays the possible total bonus (accuracy bonus +
    time bonus) and shrinks as the 30-second timer runs down. The Sketcher cannot
    make any sketches over the 30-second limit.

    </p>
<p>
  <i> <center> <small> Only the Sketcher can see which is the target. </small> </center> </i>

</p> -->

<p> There are a total of <b>48 rounds</b>. After the
final round you will fill out a quick 15 second survey and be on your way. A few final notes: First, since you are playing with another
  player, you may see this screen before the game begins:
  <p>
    <center><img src="images/waitForViewer.png" alt="initial board" style="width:700px;height:200px"></center>
  </p>
  Just hold tight. Another player should join the game within the next
  few minutes. If you're in the waiting room for 5 minutes without
  another player joining, please return the HIT and try again later!
  You will be notified when the Viewer has joined and will need to
  click a button to start the game.
</p>

<p>
  Second, please be respectful of the worker you're playing with: do
  not send inappropriate material to your partner (e.g.
  please do not "draw" words), and try to be as responsive as possible.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once you start
  the game (including the waiting page). If you refresh, you will not
  be able to rejoin the game you were in and you may not be able to
  submit the HIT. <br> Thank you!
</p>

<h4>

    Remember: being fast is important, but it's even more important to <b>maintain
    high accuracy</b>! To earn the $0.03 accuracy bonus per trial, the viewer <b>needs to select
    the CORRECT target</b>.
    <br><br>Please fill out this short quiz below before getting started. Good luck and have fun!
